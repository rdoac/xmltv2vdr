Description:

xmltv is used to provide XML based Electronic Program Guide (EPG) information
over the Internet, including channel, programmes (start and end time) and
descrptions.

Video Disk Recorder (VDR) is a linux based application used to record
programs, based on a schedule. In the UK (and maybe other countries) the
EPG information is taken from the DVB stream, and only has "now and next"
information that means it is not possible to record programs in advance
from the schedule.

This tool, xmltv2vdr.pl, puts information from xmltv into VDR for the
schedule.

Installation
------------

1) Firstly, install xmltv onto your system (see
http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv) Ensure you have installed all the
dependencies

2) Ensure that you have installed the PERL module date::manip

3) Ensure VDR is running!

4) Run tv_grab_uk (or tv_grab_XX where XX is your xmltv supported country)
--configure and select the channels to meet your package. This will put
channel information in ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_XX OR copy the provided file
tv_grab_uk to ~/.xmltv/ for UK freeview services.

5) Run tv_grab_XX > channels.xml

6) Copy your channels.conf from VDR to here (e.g. cp /video/channels.conf .)

7) Look through the channel names that you have in channels.xml and map
them to an extra field that is in the local copy of channels.conf (DO NOT
MODIFY THE FILE THAT VDR ACTUALLY USES OR YOU MIGHT BREAK IT!)

For example: -

in channels.xml : <channel id="sky-news.sky.com">

in channels.conf : Sky News (TV):578166:I0C34D0M16B8T2G32Y0:T:27500:101:102,104:0:0:22080:0:0:0:sky-news.sky.com

Note the extra field added at the end - don't forget the colon.

ALTERNATIVELY use the provided channels.conf.terr for UK freeview in this
package (crystal palace).

8) Run xmltv2vdr.pl: -

./xmltv2vdr.pl -x channels.xml -c channels.conf

Voila! You should now have extended EPG information in VDR!

Any suggestions for changes, problems that you locate, thanks, praise,

nice), please mail me. Seriously, enjoy!
